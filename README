CAIRO INTERFACE FOR GAMBIT-C					-*- outline -*-


* Disclaimer

This is a cairo (http://www.cairographics.org) interface for Gambit-C.
This works for me. It has been tested only in a few number of use-cases.

Many thanks to Marc Feeley for help and suggestions.


* Installation

Running "make" will build a loadable library "cairo.o1" in current directory.
You may need to edit Makefile in order to customize include and lib paths.
Tested with cairo 1.4.10 and libfreetype 2.3.5.


* Documentation

All functions have same interface as their C counterpart. See cairo
documentaion.
Support for Win32 graphics is missing.
cairo-svg-get-versions is missing.


* License

This package is released under terms of LGPL 2.1 (see COPYNG)
If this doesn't satisfy your requirement, feel free to conctact me.

* Examples

Directory "examples" contains some simple example.
You can run example with: gsi <example-name>
For now, all example create a .png file named as example itself.
